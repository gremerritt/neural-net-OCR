# neural-net-OCR

This project implements OCR with a neural net. It will soon be modified to be more efficient,
more parallelized, and hopefully be ported to run on a GPU.

For a great introduction to neural nets, I highly suggest reading Michael Nielsen's online book
_Neural Networks and Deep Learning_, which is available for free at: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
The general approach in this project was guided by this book.

Training and test datasets can be downloaded from MNIST: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
The dataset loader here was borrow from: https://github.com/projectgalateia/mnist
